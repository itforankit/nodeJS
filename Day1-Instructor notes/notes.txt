What is nodejs ?

// What is a web application 

Instagram

Frontend + Backend(Coding/Api + Database)
Must in Frontend  - html css and Javascript

can i say javascript is mandatory part?
JS(Must) + Java/Python/.net/php/Groovy or any other ?

in 2009 Ryna Dhall invented NOdejs 

Nodejs a runtime env to execute javascript files at system level

If before 2009 u had a file demo.js 
demo.js was executing only inside browsers/html files

we can run node demo.js

Because now we can execute js files in syatme we can talk to other applications as well like files or databases or any other software 

What? How it is built ?
It is build using the v8 chrome engine technology 

which internally uses C/C++

Electron ---

nodejs execution is node filename.js

What is REPL
Read Evaluate print loop 

// All Basic about Node js 

what is Repl is where we can directly execute javascript

for example to write js code we need a file 
create a file demo.js then we create a varibale and then we use it

if we have to check something we can directly run it in cmd 
by typing node first

// MODULES 
Any file can be called as module in nodejs 
// if ashu is good in creating chat functionaloties 
// i am going to create some functions and expose it to the world 
// it will be known as module

combining modules cn create packages 
// for example if u have to create a server , u need to send email , to send some to send nitiification , to upload some video , to talk to some database 

For all the above functionaloties we need packages 
node packages 
and to use nodepackages or javascript pakages we use npm

NPM - NODE PACKAGE MANAGER the one who is resposible for managing 
pacakges 
Creation , updation , removal and installation
npmjs.com is central repositiory where all people over the world put their 
packages and other developers install it from there and use it 

// to install a module from npm 
npm install package_name/module_name
npm install -g module_name  , -g stands for global

Local module means in the same folder 
global means available to any location it will be install global location of your pacakgesnot the local place 

to create a node package we execute a command npm init 
npm init will create a file in your folder named as package.json

package.json is file which gives all information like dependecies and scripts and etc for your package

npm start will go to package.json and seach for start script and execute what is written there 
Why the Dash we use NOdejs ?
Nodejs is using one of the very common lanagause of web devlelpment which is js so it is very to switch
NOdejs is used mainly because of its single threaded server by default

it is fast because of non blocking or async execution
non blocking means if some task is taking some time js will not wait for that task to be completed it will go to next task 
searchUsers()
searchFlights()  // it may take some fraction of seconds 
nodejs will not wait for these functions to be executed it will to next line 


nodejs works like if i am dependent on ashwini i will pass my contact information to ashwinin and once ashwiini is done with that task he will contact me either through some messaging /call or some email

async functions are we dont know thw result 

we dont know 
postgress has nothing to do with us it is just some database 
no relation with nodejs 
whenever we decide to store our data in the database we decide to pick one snd someone picked 
postgress

nodejs 2009  version 1
node 8 version allowed use to make userdefines also as asyc

We can convert user defined funtion into async function by some keywords that will come eventually in next sessions

node js will simply put some functions aside into eventloop and resume the execution
when those functions will be compoleted they will come back using a mechaism known as callback

find somthing fromdb // call a function
upload // call  a function
send sms // call a function
// send email // call a function

for every task what do we need to do call 
function calls()
som package or inbuilt 

>>>>>>>>>>>>> MODULES/PACKAGES
modules  
what is a module?
any js file is a module


we can send something from one modules to another module

one and two from one module we need something in another module
to send something to another modules we have a keyword known as exports(.)


every module by default sends an object to outside world
when any module requires that another modules it gets an object in return 

// an in that object data is stored in key value pairs 
everything is coming into an object what if i need seperately
summary of requiring modules 
// we get an object which contains data 

if we need ip and port not in an object 
// this was not possible earlier now it is possible 
How ?

export var Port  = 8080

export var IP = "127/.0.0.1

var phone = 48923439243

what is this var 
var is a keyword of javascript to decalre a variable

prefixing export keyword will allow that variable to be used by otside js files 

this is started from later javascripts which is Es6 
ES stands for ECMASCRIPT 

What is this ECMA SRCIPT ?
ECMASRCIpt is the specification of rules that states how to use javascript 

for example if anyone is very new to javasctip what u will twll to them
// to declare a variable in js we have a keyword var 
line 161 specification of var keyword or rules when kept at standard is known as ECMASCRIPT

ES 5 there is not export keyword
ES6 export

Currents NOdejs supports ES5 and ES6(only partial) so few keywords are not understood by nodejs right now 

export is new feature of es6 which allows you to send one thing seperately 

export var port  = 8080

we cant use it right now because node doesn't support without converting it inot es5 


FILE demo1.js
export var Ip = 8080
export var PORT = "Some port"


FIle demo2.js
import {Ip, PORT} from "demo1.js"


// CORE MODULES -- using which node js is built (like fs  , os , path , cluster , http, etc etc)
// NPM MODULES - install from npmjs.com / external modules 
// USER DEFINED modules --- these files which we have created like demo1 and demo2

// local global
if u wish to install any package globally 

npm install -g package_name/module_name

local installation npm install package_name/module_name

// GIT  - version control system 
if some code is not working i can go back to previous world code

initialised our folder as empty git repositiory 
// we will add remote location and assign a name to it 
 git remote add is command and origin is the name of that location
git remote add origin 
// status git status
git add filename
when ever u want to save 
commits are like checkpoints
git commit -m "your commit message"

putting ur code to github
git push remote_name branch_name 
git push origin master

to add all the files in one go git add .

but we dont want to put some files to git lets same some seret files or node_modules

then need to ignore and we need .gitignore

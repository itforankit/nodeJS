What is nodeJS?
Front End + Back End (Coding/API + DB)
Must in Front End: html CSS and JavaScript
Backend: Java/Python/.net/php/Groovy or any other?

in 2009 Ryna Dhall invented nodeJS
NodeJS a runtime env to execute javascript files

if before 2009 u had a file demo.js, it can execute only inside browser.html but after 2009 it can run at server side using node.Js
because now we can execute js files in system we can talk to other applications as well like file or datbase or any other software

it's build using v8 chrome technology which internally use c/C++

want to develop desktop app using node js need framework Electron

what is REPL?
Read Evalutae Print Loop
where we can directly execute javascript

//All about nodeJS

Modules

https://www.npmjs.com/package/node-dht-sensor

Any file can be called as module in node Js, this file contain any functionalities
combining modules create packages

to use node packages or java script packages we use npm - node package manager (creation, updatiion, removal, installation)
npmjs.com is central repository wjhere all people over the world put their packages and other developer install the packages from there

install modeule using npm
npm install modeule-name/package-name  - in the same folder
npm install -g modeule-name -g stand for Gloabal  - available to any location, will be installed at global location of your machine

npm init will create a file in your folder name as package.json, this file gives all ifnormation like dependencies and scripts and etc for your 

npm start will go to package,.json and search for the start script and execute what is written there

why the dash we use NodeJS?
NodeJS is used mainly because of it's single threaded server by default
nodejs is using one of the very common language of web development whihc is js so it's very easty to swiitch
it is fast becasue of non blocking or async execution
no blocking means if some task is taking some time, js will not wait for that task to be completed it will go to next task

async functions as re we don't know the result, hwo much time it will take

we can convert user defined fucntions in to Async functions by some keywords that will come at later

node js will cimply put some code/fucntion aside in to event loop and resume the execution
when those function will be completed, they will come back using the mechanism known as callback

Modules
---------

any js file is a module.
we can send something from one module to another module, syntax known as 

export.something (example third.js and demo1.js)

to send something to another module we have a keyword known as 

exports.

every module by default send an object to outside world, when any module requires that another modules

//we get an object which contains key values
//if we need separately not as an object, this was no tpossible earlier now it's possible, how?
//using keywprd export
prefixing export keyword before var will allow that variable to be used outside js file
this is started from later javascripts which is ES6
ES stands for ECMAScript, is the specification of rules that states how to use javascripts

ES5 no export keyword
ES6 export keyword added

currently nodeJS support ES5 and ES6 only partial hence few KW not understood by nodeJS

https://babeljs.io/ will give you teh equivalent code of ES6 to ES5


File demo1.js
export vatr ip="123.4.3.12"
export var Port="1111"

File demo2.js
import {Ip, Port} from "demo1.js"

Core Modules -- using which node js is build (OS, )
NPM Modules  -- need to install form npm
User defined Modules -- files we have created


npm install -g nodemon

nodemon file1.js  // no need to run the program again and again it will run automatically as soon as we will save the program
